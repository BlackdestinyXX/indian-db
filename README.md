## Ok, so, what are the functions?
This database has got 1 class and 6 methods:<br>
For first, we need to create the indian:<br>
`const indiandb = require("indian-db")\n
const guy = new indiandb.Indian("Cool-guy")
`
<br>
If we want to delete the indian, we need to use this class:<br>
`const indiandb = require("indian-db")`
<br>
 `const guy = new indiandb.Indian("Cool-guy")`
 <br>
 `indiandb.DeleteIndian("Cool-guy")`
<br>
To insert an element into the database, we can use this method:<br>
`const indiandb = require("indian-db")`<br>
 `const guy = new indiandb.Indian("Cool-guy")`<br>
 `guy.hello("computer", "virus")`
