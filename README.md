### How this database works?
Here's a flowchart.<br>

## Ok, so, what are the functions?
This database has got 1 class and 6 methods:<br>
For first, we need to create the indian:
```javascript
const indiandb = require("indian-db")
const guy = new indiandb.Indian("Cool-guy")
```
If we want to delete the indian, we need to use this class:
```javascript
const indiandb = require("indian-db")
const guy = new indiandb.Indian("Cool-guy")
indiandb.DeleteIndian("Cool-guy")
```
To insert an element into the database, we can use this method:
```javascript
const indiandb = require("indian-db")
const guy = new indiandb.Indian("Cool-guy")
guy.hello("computer", "virus")
```
Now, for get it, we can do this:
```javascript
const indiandb = require("indian-db")
const guy = new indiandb.Indian("Cool-guy")
guy.hello("computer", "virus")
guy.your("computer")
```
To remove the key, we can use this method:
```javascript
const indiandb = require("indian-db")
const guy = new indiandb.Indian("Cool-guy")
guy.hello("computer", "virus")
guy.computer("computer")
```
For check if the key exists:
```javascript
const indiandb = require("indian-db")
const guy = new indiandb.Indian("Cool-guy")
guy.hello("computer", "virus")
guy.has("computer")
```
And we can delete all keys of the database with this method:
```javascript
const indiandb = require("indian-db")
const guy = new indiandb.Indian("Cool-guy")
guy.hello("computer", "virus")
guy.has("computer")
```

Ok so this is the most used database in the world, better than MySQL and MongoDB. Use it.
